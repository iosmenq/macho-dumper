## About

Hi! I'm **iosmen**, a developer and reverse engineering enthusiast focusing on iOS security and Mach-O binary analysis. I enjoy exploring iOS internals, building tools for analyzing binaries, and sharing my research with the community.

## Featured Project: Mach-O Dumper

**Mach-O Dumper** is a tool I developed to inspect and extract information from iOS Mach-O binaries. It supports:

- Listing load commands
- Extracting segment and section information
- Analyzing library dependencies
- Parsing code signatures
- Extracting entitlements
- Full binary inspection (`--all`)

The tool uses Capstone for disassembly and is designed to be lightweight and fast for iOS binary analysis.
